Would you say that of our slain comrades?\nWhat about their lives? Were they meaningless?... They were not! Their memory serves as an example to us all! The courageous fallen! The anguished fallen!\nTheir lives have meaning because we the living refuse to forget them!\nAnd as we ride to certain death, we trust our successors to do the same for us! Because my soldiers do not buckle or yield when faced with the cruelty of this world!\nMy soldiers push forward! My soldiers scream out! My soldiers RAAAAAGE!",
